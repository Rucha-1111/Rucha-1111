## 👋 Hii, I’m Rucha!

### 🧠 About Me
I write code that works - and **_documentation_** that explains **why it works** (so no one has to reverse-engineer it later).

With hands-on experience in **backend development**, **system logic**, and **workflows**, I enjoy building software and then making it understandable for humans.

I work across **feature implementation**, **APIs**, **backend workflows**, **error handling**, and **system flows**, translating business requirements into both functional code and clear, developer-friendly documentation. I’m comfortable switching between coding and writing, and I believe good software isn’t finished until someone else can pick it up and say:

> *“Yep, this makes sense.”*

### What I do
- Design and implement **backend features** with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and real-world usage  
- Document **REST APIs** with clear endpoints, request/response examples, and edge cases  
- Write **system and workflow documentation** explaining how components interact behind the scenes  
- Translate **business and product requirements** into technical implementations and supporting documentation  
- Document **error handling, validations, and failure scenarios** to reduce ambiguity during development and testing  
- Create **developer-friendly guides** for onboarding, usage, and internal knowledge sharing  
- Collaborate with developers and stakeholders to keep documentation **accurate and in sync with the code**
