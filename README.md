### 🧠 About Me
I am an aspiring **Technical Writer and Documentation Specialist** with a strong foundation in software development and backend systems.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of **technology, communication, and problem-solving**, where I can translate complex technical concepts into clear, structured, and user-focused content.

I am particularly interested in:
- Creating **developer-friendly API documentation**
- Writing **clear user guides and onboarding material**
- Translating **business requirements into functional documentation**
- Documenting **system workflows, backend logic, and error-handling strategies**
- Improving product usability through **well-structured, easy-to-navigate documentation**

My technical background allows me to understand how systems are built, which helps me create documentation that is accurate, practical, and aligned with real-world use cases.
